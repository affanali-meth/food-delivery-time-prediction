# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Overview
A machine learning regression project to predict food delivery time using real-world features such as distance, traffic level, weather, time of day, preparation time, and courier experience.

## Workflow
- Data loading and basic EDA
- Missing value handling (median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation

## Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
